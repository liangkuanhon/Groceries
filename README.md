## Known Issues / Crashes
* **Orientation-related crashes**  
  Certain activities or fragments may crash when the screen orientation changes.  
  *Workaround:* Lock the screen orientation while using the app.

* **Mismatched routing after navigating back**  
  Some grocery items may appear out of order or incorrectly routed if the Android back button is used during routing.  
  *Workaround:* Use the in-app navigation buttons instead for a clean transition.

* **Navigation bar layout inconsistencies**  
  On some devices, the navigation bar may appear cut off or not fixed to the bottom. This is suspected to be an issue with XML layout constraints and device-specific behaviors.
